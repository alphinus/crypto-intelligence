## The Problem

### Trading Blind Is Expensive

Every day, traders lose money – not because they lack strategy, but because they lack the right information:

- **Information Overload**: Dozens of tabs, countless indicators, conflicting signals
- **Too Slow**: By the time you've analyzed all timeframes, the opportunity is gone
- **Emotional Decisions**: Without clear data, FOMO and panic take over
- **Missed Confluence**: The best setups happen when multiple factors align – but who has time to track that manually?

## The Solution

### One Dashboard. All Insights. Real-Time.

Crypto Intelligence bundles everything you need for professional trading:

**AI Analyzes. You Decide.**

Our AI evaluates technical indicators, market sentiment, and on-chain data – delivering clear recommendations with a simple scoring system:

| Score | Verdict | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 70+ | **TAKE IT** | Quality setup – consider the trade |
| 45-69 | **RISKY** | Proceed with caution – elevated risk |
| <45 | **LEAVE IT** | Not recommended – better to wait |
